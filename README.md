## Abstractions on BioPAX graphs

This repository contains codes to generate contextual abstractions (views) on BioPAX knowledge graphs. 

Abstractions are generated with SPARQL queries integrated in Jupyter notebooks.

The abstractions provided are :
- SIF abstraction : abstraction of proteins and small molecules interactions from the SIF (Simple Interaction Format) abstraction rules from PathwayCommons (http://www.pathwaycommons.org/pc2/formats#sif_relations)

The ReactomeData folder contains pathway examples from Reactome in the BioPAX format to test the abstractions generation.
